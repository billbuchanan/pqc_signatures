Reporting bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maintainer wishes to be made aware of any and all bugs.  Please send an
email with your bug report to the FLINT devel list
https://groups.google.com/group/flint-devel.

If possible please include details of your system, the version of GCC, the
versions of GMP/MPIR and MPFR as well as precise details of how to replicate
the bug.

Note that FLINT needs to be linked against version 2.6.0 or later of MPIR
(or version 5.1.1 or later of GMP), version 3.0.0 or later of MPFR and
must be compiled with gcc version 2.96 or later. Version 4.8 or later of GCC
is recommended for parallel builds and use of the ``C++`` interface.
