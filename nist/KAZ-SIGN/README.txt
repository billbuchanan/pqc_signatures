IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

The KAZ-SIGN algorithm accepts values of \delta \in (0,1) as mentioned in the 
KAZ-SIGN Algorithm Specifications in the submission package for the Post-Quantum 
Cryptographic Algorithm Submissions by NIST. For execution purposes in the 
submission, we utilize the value \delta=0.3. As such, it will be understood 
by those skilled in the art that various changes upon the value of \delta 
can be done and in turn will provide different parameter lengths for 
targeted security levels.
