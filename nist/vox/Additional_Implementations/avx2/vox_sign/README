VOX signature scheme
====================

### Dependencies

OpenSSL

OpenSSL is only used in the randombytes() function provided by NIST for KAT generation.

### Usage

This is a portable implementation written in C. To compile and run the code,
simply do

```sh
make clean
make PARAM=VOX256
./test/PQCgenKAT_sign
./test/vox_test
```

To select a different parameter set, replace the argument `PARAM=VOX256` as appropriate.

### License

This implementation is available under the MIT license below,
but we use the following third-party code under a different license :
  - keccak (in `fips202/` folder), based on public domain implementations

    based on the public domain implementation from XKCP.
    * Public domain
    * BSD-3 clause for file `fips202/keccak4x/brg_endian.h`
  - DRBG (in `rng/` folder) and KAT program (file `test/PQCgenKAT_sign.c`)
