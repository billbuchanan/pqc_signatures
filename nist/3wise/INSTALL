Debian uses FLINT version 2.6.3 and 2.8.2 for Ubuntu. These versions dont't have required fmpz_mod_mat functions (rank and inverse) between others.
These were aggregated later, so version 2.9.0 is required.

Tested OS:

Fresh Debian GNU/LINUX 11 (Bullseye)
Fresh Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.2 LTS

Remark: You can use multiple threads to compile e:g make -j16 for sixteen threads. 

Installation steps (Ubuntu & Debian)

1) Install basic packages like C/C++ compilers, OpenSSL and FLINT dependencies

sudo apt install make gcc g++ libssl-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev

2) Fetch & Install Flint 2.9.0

wget https://github.com/flintlib/flint2/archive/refs/tags/v2.9.0.tar.gz
tar xfz v2.9.0.tar.gz
cd flint2-2.9.0
./configure
make
make check (OPTIONAL, slow process, just test validation)
sudo make install
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libflint.so.17.0.0 /usr/lib/
sudo ln /usr/lib/libflint.so.17.0.0 /usr/lib/libflint.so.17

(You can find more info about tuning and installing flint at https://github.com/flintlib/flint2/blob/trunk/INSTALL)

Arch Linux & Kali Linux:

Install all dependencies from package manager (pacman, apt) as FLINT is present at version 2.9.0 

On OpenBSD ARM64 (Raspberry PI 4b):

OpenBSD comes with a basic toolchain for C/C++ compiling with Clang, yet some GNU features like make, autoreconf ...
For installing flint use gmake instead of make and follow same steps (cp and ln commands)
To compile follow this example using clang:
cc -I /usr/local/include -L /usr/local/lib test.c $(HEADERS) $(SOURCES) $(LDFLAGS) $(OPTIMIZED) -std=c99
