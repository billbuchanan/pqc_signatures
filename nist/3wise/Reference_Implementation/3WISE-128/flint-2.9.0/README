FLINT 2
=======

FLINT (Fast Library for Number Theory) is a C library in support of computations
in number theory. It's also a research project into algorithms in number theory.

FLINT 2 is a complete rewrite of the FLINT library from scratch. It includes
much cleaner code and in many cases much faster algorithms and implementations.

At this stage FLINT consists mainly of fast integer and polynomial 
arithmetic and linear algebra. In the future it is planned that FLINT will 
contain algorithms for algebraic number theory and other number theoretic
functionality.
