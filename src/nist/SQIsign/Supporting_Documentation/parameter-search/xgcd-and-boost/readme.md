C++ implementation of the XGCD-and-boost approach

To run, set the parameters in the main function,
and run `make`. This produces `xgcd_and_boost.exe`.
Results are stored in files in the `results` folder.
Use `Ctrl + C` to show the status (counter and hit rate),
and `Ctrl + C` twice to stop the program.
