Notes
=====

Each implementation under Reference_Implementation and
Optimized_Implementation has its own Makefile; when used, it compiles
the code. The resulting binary (created in the same directory), when
executed, produced the .req and .rsp files, which should be identical
to the ones provided in KAT/.

User should have `openssl` installed before making the binary.

For Debian-based linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntuâ€¦ etc), follow the below instructions to install prerequisites.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev -y
