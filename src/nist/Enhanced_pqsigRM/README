This package includes supporting documents, reference implementation, optimized implementation, and KAT for pqsigRM.
This reference implementation and optimized implementation are the implementation of a post-quantum digital signature algorithm, pqsigRM.
The source code is tested under intel x64 cpu, ubuntu 22.04
There is one variant of Enhanced pqsigRM.

Enh-pqsigRM-613
	A digital signature algorithm with 128-bit security (Category 1)


# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

	The source requires ANSI C compiler, and OpenSSL library for C. 
	AVX2 support for optimized implementation.

# COMPILING:
	
	This source can be compiled with gcc
	
	<Computing runtime>
	make clean; make runtime; ./runtime

	<KAT>
	make clean; make sign; ./sign
