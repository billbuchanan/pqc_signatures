Cover Sheet and signed statements (section 2.D) are located in the specification's PDF.

Each implementation has its own MAKEFILE that is comprised of the following:
    
    - Optimized KAT test values generation. MAKEFILE is tunable you can disable OPTIMIZED flag here
		- KAT Generation time n=128 4sec, n=192 33sec, n=256 1.55min
    - Unoptimized performance test in single core.
    - Optimized performance test in single core.

Each algorithm has its tunable parameters in api.h

Used files in the implementations are:

    - gen.c, gen.h: For generating the Public and Private key.
    - serializer.c, serializer.h: Encoding and Decoding of Public and Private key.
    - sign.c: For message signing and signature verification.
    - MAKEFILE: For building KAT and performance testing binaries.

Reference and Optimized implementations are both the same.

In Third Party libraries you will found libraries used by the implementations that are not covered by NIST in the FAQs. These are:
    
    - FLINT
	
Please read the attached INSTALL file carefully.
